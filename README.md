# Rails template

This is a template I use for my new Ruby on Rails 4 applications.


## How to Use

```bash
rails new [app_name] -m rails_startup_template/template.rb
```

## What it does

1. Adds the following gems:
  - [twitter-bootstrap-rails](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/): Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
  - [therubyracer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer): Embeding the V8 JavaScript interpreter into Ruby
  - [less-rails](https://github.com/metaskills/less-rails): The dynamic stylesheet language for the Rails asset pipeline

## To do

Updates for other used gems will be added when needed.
